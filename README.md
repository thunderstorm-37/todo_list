# Todo_list

This is a private todo list, designed to help the repository owner track and continuously update pending tasks.

## Github Action
1. On every git push, the spelling of files (including *.tex, *.md and *.yaml) will be checked. 
If there are unexpected mistakes in misspelled wordlist, you can add them to wordlist.txt after confirming that they are correct.

2. On every git push, the TeX file is compiled using 'xelatex'.

3. Compiled PDF is available as a Github Action artifact.
